This project is the simplest thing that could possibly work for an Ipad Book. It is a PhotoScroller using an Apple Sample project.
The Photoscroller is a carousel which always keeps three photos in memory. The last, current, and next photos.

It includes an xcode 4 project file and will run as is. This book has been accepted into the Appstore http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voluptuousity-magazine-1. so it is 'proven' technology.

To change the book simply replace the pictures in the Images/FullImages directory with your own images and adjust the metadata in ImageData.plist.

I used Adobe inDe3sign to lay out the book. inDesign has an export as jpeg feature which created the individual photos.

Future developments. I plan on building a visual Table of Contents using a photoPicker component. and adding a menubar at the bottom of the screen.

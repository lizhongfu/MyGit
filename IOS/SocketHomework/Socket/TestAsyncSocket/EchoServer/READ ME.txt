THIS MAY NOT BE THE LATEST VERSION OF THE CODE!

This version is dated from April of 2009.

You can always get the latest version of the code using subversion from the google code project page here:
http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/source/checkout

Also, this download is a subset of the entire project.  There is also a UDP socket version named AsyncUdpSocket, and there is further sample code available.
